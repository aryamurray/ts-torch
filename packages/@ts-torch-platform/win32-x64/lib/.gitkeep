# Native binaries will be placed here

This directory will contain the compiled native binaries for Windows x64:
- ts_torch.node - Node.js native addon
- ts_torch.dll - Dynamic library (if needed)
- Other platform-specific binaries

## Building Native Binaries

To build the native binaries for this platform:

1. Ensure you have the required build tools:
   - Visual Studio 2019 or later (with C++ tools)
   - CMake 3.15 or later
   - PyTorch C++ libraries (libtorch)

2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cd native
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
   cmake --build . --config Release
   ```

3. Copy the built binaries to this directory:
   ```bash
   cp build/Release/ts_torch.node packages/@ts-torch-platform/win32-x64/lib/
   ```

## Note

The `.gitkeep` file is a placeholder. Once you add actual binary files,
you can remove this file. Make sure to add the binary files to your
`.gitignore` if they should not be committed to version control.
